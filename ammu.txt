Some days feel quiet, like the world forgot your name,
But flowers still bloom — even when skies are tame.
You’re made of stories, of stardust and grace,
Even in silence, you’re taking your place.

Not every petal opens in spring,
Some take their time — it’s a beautiful thing.
So when you feel lost, or shadows fall near,
Just whisper inside: “I’m still blooming here.”

A little bit slower, a little unsure,
But growing in ways that are quiet and pure.
You don’t have to shine just to be bright —
Even soft hearts can light up the night. 🌙✨
